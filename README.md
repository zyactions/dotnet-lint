A GitHub Action to lint .NET projects. 

## Features

- Lints .NET projects using the official [dotnet format][dotnet-format] .NET CLI tool
- Creates pull request annotations for detected code style violations
- Registers a [problem matcher][problem-matchers] for error output
- Supports all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Usage

### Lint

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: .NET Lint
    uses: zyactions/dotnet-lint@v1
    with:
      workspace: test
      implicit-restore: true
```

> **Note**
>
> Unlike the wrapped `dotnet format` command, this action does not perform an implicit package restore by default. A manual package restore (e.g. using [zyactions/dotnet-restore][zyactions-dotnet-restore]) is required by design.
>
> Set `implicit-restore` to `true` to switch back to the original behavior.

### Lint a specific Project- or Solution

```yaml
steps:
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: .NET Lint
    uses: zyactions/dotnet-lint@v1
    with:
      workspace: test/Test.csproj
      implicit-restore: true
```

### Lint only specific Files using a Glob Pattern

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Glob Match
    id: glob
    uses: zyactions/glob@v2
    with:
      pattern: |
        test/*.cs
        !test/*.AutoGenerated.cs
      return-pipe: true

  - name: .NET Lint
    uses: zyactions/dotnet-lint@v1
    with:
      workspace: test/Test.csproj
      include: '-'
      pipe: ${{ steps.glob.outputs.pipe }}
      implicit-restore: true
```

## Inputs

### `workspace`

The Visual Studio workspace (directory, project- or solution-file).

The `dotnet restore` command automatically searches for a Visual Studio Solution file (`*.sln`) in the specified workspace directory, if no explicit solution- or project- file is specified.

Example values:

- `path/to/workspace`
- `path/to/Solution.sln`
- `path/to/Project.csproj`

### `diagnostics`

A newline-separated list of diagnostic IDs to use as a filter when linting code style or third-party issues. Default value is whichever IDs are listed in the `.editorconfig` file. For a list of built-in analyzer rule IDs that you can specify, see the [list of IDs for code-analysis style rules][style-rules].

### `severity`

The minimum severity of diagnostics to lint. Allowed values are `info`, `warn`, and `error`. The default value is `warn`.

### `include`

A newline-separated list of relative file or folder paths to include in linting. The default is all files in the solution or project.

Use `-` to read the list of files from the `pipe` input.

### `exclude`

A newline-separated list of relative file or folder paths to exclude from linting.

The default is none.

Use `-` to read the list of files from the `pipe` input.

### `report-path`

Produces a JSON report in the specified directory.

### `implicit-restore`

Execute an implicit restore before linting.

### `pipe`

An optional pipe input from which the `include` or `exclude` filenames are to be read.

This must be set to a valid shell command line (bash) that can be used for piping. The command must output to `stdout` and separate the individual filenames by line breaks.

> **Warning**
>
> The command passed to this input will be evaluated and should not come from untrusted sources.

## Requirements

The [.NET CLI][dotnet-sdk] needs to be installed on the runner. To be independent from the GitHub defaults, it's recommended to install a specific version of the SDK prior to calling this action.

To install the .NET SDK in your workflow, the following actions can be used:

- [zyactions/dotnet-setup][zyactions-dotnet-setup]
- [actions/setup-dotnet][actions-setup-dotnet]

## Dependencies

This action uses the following GitHub Actions dependencies:

- [zyactions/dotnet-format][zyactions-dotnet-format] (pinned)

## Versioning

Versions follow the [semantic versioning scheme][semver].
