branding:
  icon: code
  color: purple

inputs:
  working-directory:
    description: >
      The working-directory for the action.

      Defaults to the repository root directory (`github.workspace`).

      If a specific .NET SDK version is to be used, the working directory must point to the
      directory that contains the `global.json` or a subdirectory of it.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.workspace }}
  workspace:
    description: >
      The Visual Studio workspace (directory, project- or solution-file).

      This path is relative to the `working-directory` unless an absolute path is used.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  diagnostics:
    description: >
      A newline-separated list of diagnostic IDs to use as a filter when linting code style or
      third-party issues. Supports multiline strings.

      Default value is whichever IDs are listed in the  `.editorconfig` file.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  severity:
    description: >
      The minimum severity of diagnostics to lint.

      Possible values:
      - info
      - warn
      - error

      The default value is `warn`.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  include:
    description: >
      A newline-separated list of relative file or folder paths to include in linting.

      The default is all files in the solution or project.

      Use `-` to read the list of files from the `pipe` input.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  exclude:
    description: >
      A newline-separated list of relative file or folder paths to exclude from linting.

      The default is none.

      Use `-` to read the list of files from the `pipe` input.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  report-path:
    description: Produces a JSON report in the specified directory.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  implicit-restore:
    description: Execute an implicit restore before linting.
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
  use-standalone-tool:
    description: >
      Uses the standalone version of the `dotnet-format` tool instead of the version bundled
      with the .NET SDK.
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
  pipe:
    description: >
      An optional pipe input from which the `include` or `exclude` filenames are to be read.

      This must be set to a valid shell command line (bash) that can be used for piping. The
      command must output to `stdout` and separate the individual filenames by line breaks.

      WARNING:
      The command passed to this input will be evaluated and should not come from untrusted
      sources.
    type: string
    required: false
