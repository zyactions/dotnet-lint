    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  diagnostics:
    description: >
      A newline-separated list of diagnostic IDs to use as a filter when linting code style or
      third-party issues. Supports multiline strings.

      Default value is whichever IDs are listed in the  `.editorconfig` file.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  severity:
    description: >
      The minimum severity of diagnostics to lint.

      Possible values:

      - warn
      - error

      The default value is `warn`.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  include:
    description: >
      A newline-separated list of relative file or folder paths to include in linting.

      The default is all files in the solution or project.

      Use `-` to read the list of files from the `pipe` input.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  exclude:
    description: >
      A newline-separated list of relative file or folder paths to exclude from linting.

      The default is none.

  report-path:

      This must be set to a valid shell command line (bash) that can be used for piping. The
      command must output to `stdout` and separate the individual filenames by line breaks.

      WARNING:
      The command passed to this input will be evaluated and should not come from untrusted
      sources.
